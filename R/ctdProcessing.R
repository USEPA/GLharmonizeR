# This function isn't explicitly used in the package. Instead, it was used to
# preprocess CTD data (specifically data stored on SeaBird). The processing script 
# is scripts/seaBirdProcessing.R 

# [ ] KV: Seems like this script should be moved to the 'scripts' folder if it is not a core package function and was only used to preprocess CTD data. You could instead source it directly in the processing files so that it loads, if that is part of the reason why it is in the R directory
# [ ] KV: Looks like this function was also used to process NOAA's CTD data, is that right? If so, please update description above.
# [ ] KV: I am surprised a single function could be written to cover both GLNPO's and NOAA's CTD data - please carefully ensure that the function is working correctly for both 

# Note: KV will need to recheck function after clarifications/checks are made


# Convert conductance with the following (suggested by James Gerads)
# [microS/cm]  = (C * 10,000) / (1 + A * [T â€“ 25]) with (C = conductivity (S/m), T = temperature (C), A = thermal coefficient of conductivity
