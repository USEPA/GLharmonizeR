## [General process](docs/useNdesign.md)
In general, this toolbox is meant to aid researchers by reading, cleaning, and joining data from different sources for Lake Michigan. This toolbox does the following (each of which will be documented more thoroughly in the following sections)

- Download data from remote sources (under construction)
- Clean each dataset individually
- Combine into a unified dataset

## Data sources
The data were taken from the following sources

- The Great Lakes Environmental Database, [GLNPO](https://cdx.epmeea.gov/)
- CSMI (hosted locally)
- National Coastal Condition Assessment, [NCCA](https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/ncca)
- National Oceanic and atmospheric Administration, [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/)
- [WQP](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/)

## [Data Cleaning](docs/dataCleaning.md)
Here we'll outline the general steps that were ran to clean each individual data source.
