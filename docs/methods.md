# Analyte information
Analytes from the sources listed above include any chemical or physical measurements that were taken for a given unique site/time observation. In general, each data source had a unique method of reporting and naming analytes. In order to compile them into a common data source, a common naming convention derived from the Water quality exchange (WQX) database was used as a map.

## Naming convention (mapping to WQX characteristics)
Analytes were matched to WQP entries for CharacteristicName. Those without a direct match or with a partial match (names that matched some subset of Analyte name, especiation, or fraction) were resolved with expert domaing knowledge. Here is a list of Analytes which had partial matches with their suggested names:

- ijaklsdjf
- place holder 

Analyte short names were developed using domain knowledge of common abbreviations used in literature. WQX columns specifying whether the fraction or especiation were needed to simplify these short names when possible.


## Cleaning
The data were cleaned wherever it was obvious that aspects would not be useful to downstream analyses for as broad an audience as possible. Instances that were ambiguous have an associated comment with them (see Results comments/Flags for more information). Here are a list of the unambiguous
