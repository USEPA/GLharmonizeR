Description: This package loads in-situ water quality data from NCCA, CSMI, and GLENDA covering the years 2010, 2015, and 2020/2021,
    plus some additional data in a number of other years comprised of both CTD and lab sample data. It standardizes the data for joining
    and runs quality control checks on each of the data sources separately as well as in its integrated state. It is meant to lower the 
    barrier of entry for researchers interested in water quality in the great lakes over this time period.
