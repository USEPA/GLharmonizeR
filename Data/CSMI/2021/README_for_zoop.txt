Zooplankton density file (Kansas Keeton):
1)	The densities were sorted into the epilimnion and hypolimnion using a proportional calculation.
2)	This means that the Total Density may be different than simply the sum of the epi density and the hypo density. Sometimes it is the same, sometimes it is not, depending on if the densities in the epilimnion were higher than the densities in the hypolimnion, in which case the densities of the “deep” tow was used as the hypo density. There is a column called “DeepTow_Density_m3” that verifies the total density. 

Depth classes for the each species are included (whether they were taken in the shallow tow “S” or the deep tow “D”).
