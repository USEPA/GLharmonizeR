50M,Fifty Meter,Sample was collected fifty meters below the surface of the water body
5M,Five Meter,Sample was collected five meters below the surface of the water body
B-,Bottom Minus,Sample was collected from 1-2 meters above the bottom of the water body ( 1 or 2 meters not specified)
B1,Bottom Minus 1,Sample was collected 1 meter above the bottom of the water body
B10,Bottom Minus 10,Samples was collected from 10 meters above the bottom of the water body
B2,Bottom Minus 2,Sample was collected 2 meters above the bottom of the water body
D100,Integrated 100,Sample was collected across the area from 0-100 meters from the water surface 
D20,Integrated 20,Sample was collected across the area from 0-20 meters from the water surface
DCL,Deep Chlorophyll Layer,Sample was collected at the location below the thermocline where the flourometer shows a maximum value over the water column
EP,Epilimnion,"Sample was collected from the warm, aerated upper layer of the water body. The epilimnion lies above the thermocline"
HY,Hypolimnion,"Sample was collected from the lower, cooler layer of water in the water body. The hypolimnion lies below the thermocline"
INT-SPR,"Integrated, Spring","Sample is a composite of samples collected from 1 meter, 5 meters, 10 meters, and 20 meters below the water surface"
INT-SUM,"Integrated, Summer","Sample is a composite of samples collected from 1 meter, 5 meters, and 10 meters below the water surface and from the Lower Epilimnion"
LEP,Lower Epilimnion,Sample was collected from the lower portion of the epilimnion
LHY,Lower Hypolimnion,Sample was collected from the lower portion of the hypolimnion
MEP,Mid Epilimnion,Sample was collected midpoint between the water surface and the lower epilimnion (depth = LEP depth/2)
MHY,Mid Hypolimnion,Sample was collected from the midpoint between the upper hypolimnion and the bottom (depth = (UHY depth + total depth)/2)
MID,Middle Depth,Sample was collected from the midpoint between the water surface and the bottom
SRF,Surface,Sample was collected from 1-2 meters below the water surface
SYN,Synthetic Sample,Sample depth is not applicable because sample was a synthetic sample.
TRM,Thermocline,Sample was collected from the layer of the lake that exhibits an abrupt temperature gradient and separates other layers that differ in temperature
UEP,Upper Epilimnion,Sample was collected from the upper portion of the epilimnion
UHY,Upper Hypolimnion,Sample was collected from the upper portion of the hypolimnion
