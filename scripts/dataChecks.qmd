```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(kable)
library(kableExtra)
df <- read_csv("Data/fulldata.csv")
```


# Missingness
```{r}
colMeans(is.na(df)) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kableExtra::kable_paper()

df %>%
  reframe(across(everything(), function(x) mean(is.na(x))), .by = Study) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kableExtra::kable_paper()
```

Notes on missingness:
- GLENDA
  - Missing 3% of lat/longs/depths
  - missing values is a function of how inefficient 
- SeaBird
  - Can't locate station depth in their files
- NCCA
  - WQ 2010 has 15% missingness
  - WQ 2015 has 30% missingness
    - Has ANL_CODE not ANALYTE
  - Secchi missing sample depth because it is an integrated sample (over water column)

- CSMI
  - 2010
    - Lat/Lon reported only to nearest whole number 
      - there are real Lat/ real Lon in smpstts10.xls, but not sure what they mean
    - Lat/Lon/depth/sampleDate partially missing because odd reporting in file
      - Can we use forward filling to fill in the missing values?
    - Can't find sampleDepth
      - Just report the water layer
