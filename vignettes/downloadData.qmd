# Setup
You may need to install the package (Note that while this is private, it may require your GitHub PAT to install)
```{r install}
devtools::install_github("kvitense/LM_Chla@initialCodeReview")
```

Download the data. Then, you have the option to specify the output filepath "out" where the data will be saved as well as the file format with binaryOut. TRUE- will store the data as a .Rds file whereas FALSE will store it as a .csv file. We reccomend setting binaryOut to TRUE for performance as long as you are comfortable loading .Rds files. 
```{r downloadData}
df <- LMChla::assembleData(out = "fullData", binaryOut = TRUE)

```
